# AI Coding Day One

Started using Cursor today. It seems like the tool of choice to get up and running so this was a good starting point. People also talk a lot about Claude Code so to get the most out of my journey I switching to the Sonnet 4.5 model in Cursor to help me on the journey (for now).

The goal of this project is to have a very simple site that I can use to keep track of my journey with AI-assisted tools. With this in mind my first set of prompts built out the foundations with a very simple index HTML page and CSS file. The first version was quick opinionated in style, but this needed to be simple in both functionality and in aesthetics. So after a few tweaks we got to a minimally styled page.

I did however want a little more sophistication when viewing the site whilst building things out. So this is why I opted to prompt for a local server to run at localhost:8000 (so I'm not digging through directories to open the page), and the worthy addition of a hot reload so changes are visible immediately on save.

This feels fun. 30 minutes and a couple of small wins that ironically remind me of a simpler time of web dev.

**Next up: a nicer writing experience.**
